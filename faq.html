    <h4 class="center side">Q: How do I purchase surfaces?</h4>

    <h4 class="center side">Q: What's the return policy?</h4>
    <p class="center side">Please note all surfaces are checked carefully by us before shipping.</p>

    <ul>
        <li class="side">The material of the surface is a canvas which is a cloth and it has been used for a variety of photography around the world. Please read our material and care description carefully before placing orders.</li>
        <li class="side">Most surfaces have a visible left-over paint marks at the back of the surface. This is just a part of creating a multi-layer painted surface.</li>
        <li class="side">The surfaces are purely hand painted; we cannot guarantee that these will be the same as the photos. Though we strive our best to take the most natural picture, do look at all the pictures of a surface in the product page to get an idea of subtle
            color differences you may see in photos taken at different times.</li>
        <li class="side">If our surface has any problem, please contact us within 5 days of receipt of your order, if our surface not the problem, we cannot accept a return after 5 days because of the special nature of our products.</li>
        <li class="side">Please note, we do not provide return shipping labels - you are responsible for the cost of shipping the surfaces back to us.
        </li>

    </ul>


    <h4 class="center side">Q: Whats the best way to store my surface?</h4>
    <p class="center side">The best way to store your hand-painted surface is to roll it up in the tube in which you received the surface. You may also roll up multiple surfaces together and store them in one tube. Lastly, you may also lay them up straight on a flat surface
        and cover them. It is a good way to get rid of dust, dirt or creases. Make sure the tubes are placed in the clean and dry environment and away from direct sunlight. The damp environment and sunlight may lead to color change and fade the backdrop.
    </p>
    <p class="center side"> Your hand-painted surface is a piece of art.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li class="side">DO NOT fold a hand-painted surface!</li>
        <li class="side">DO NOT wash a hand-painted surface!</li>
        <li class="side">DO NOT stand or place your hand on a hand-painted surface!</li>
        <li class="side">DO NOT place knives or sharp-edge objects unsupervised on a hand-painted surface!</li>
    </ul>

    <p class="center side">Store flat or in the tube so when you extend it will lie flat. With proper care and storage, you can keep your Rainbow Surface looking great from year to year and provide professional photo effect for ages!</p>


    <h4 class="center side">Q: Are you a food photographer or blogger?</h4>
    <p class="center side">Post the photos or videos with our surfaces on your page and tag us @rainbowsurfaces on Instagram.
    </p>
    <p class="center side">We are looking for some excellent photographers. If you think you can do it, please contact us. After you become our partner photographer and if we have some new surfaces, you will get an exclusive first eyes and discount for photographers.</p>
